demo.launch(server_name="192.168.0.xx", server_port=7860)

if you want to serve on your machine demo.launch() is enough

if you want to serve to LAN clients, than set server_name="192.168.0.xx" according to your LAN ip

if you want to serve to everybody connected to internet demo.launch(share= True) is enough
